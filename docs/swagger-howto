To Edit:
    window 1: (for the main editor; :8081)
        cd ~/Code/dev/bin/ && ./swagger-ed
    window 2: (needed to $ref to work; basic server just needs --cors and the main.yaml file to be in the root; probably :8082)
        cd ~/to/the/location/of/your/main.yaml && ~/Code/dev/bin/swagger-ed-endpoint

    Load main editor: http://127.0.0.1:8081/#/
    Make sure Preferences -> Preferences -> Pointer Resolution Base Path is set to the ed-endpoint address, maybe:
      http://127.0.0.1:8082/
      This server needs to be started so that the main.yaml file that includes all the references is there.

   Edit, reload, etc. Might need to disable cache in Dev Tools to see some changes.

To Generate:
    The problem is that swagger is young and it's painful to get it all. I like the separate yaml files, and thankfully
    there was a gulp require to combine the yaml and spit out json. Whew!

    https://github.com/gersongoulart/gulp-swagger
    Follow instructions to generate json, which will linked by unique-site-name.json in future steps.

To View:
    ln -s the json generated into the root, or create a route, like:

        Route::get('/dev/swagger.json', function () {
            return File::get(base_path('docs/swagger/punchcardv10.json'));
        });
