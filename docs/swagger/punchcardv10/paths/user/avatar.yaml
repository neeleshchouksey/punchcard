    ## Testing

    Please test this endpoint with several users. Also, try updating (see `PUT` below) with a new avatar you find from a google
    image search, and then see if it is updated when you come back here. This will not return a JSON array, but it will return
    the image itself. You should see an image in this endpoint.

    - image/png

    ## Testing

    This actually requires a base64-encoded image. If you are familiar with command line Mac or Linux, you can use the
    command line program 'base64' to encode an image:

      1. Download an image
      1. find it on the command line (eg cd ~/Downloads)
      1. base64 filename.png
      1. copy the gibberish that is output between the quotes in "image" ""
      1. Try a `PUT` to see if it works. The server should read the encoded string, decode it and save the file for
         the authenticated user.

    Please do this with a variety of images - small, big, huge, jpg, png, etc. You can use other image types, like gif and tiff,
    to ensure they do not work. We only support .jpg and .png images. I would like a test story for each image type, and grouped
    by 5-10 sizes, like 'less than 50k', '50k - 100k', etc.
