    ## Testing

    Please test this endpoint with several users, using different `uniq_id`.  Please find 5-7 different `uniq_id`
    from users and try them, using a variety of user roles and status. For example, a test story might cover:

      1. User who has 'status' = 'active' and 'role' = 'user' views avatar from user who is 'status' = 'active' and 'role' = 'user'
      1. User who has 'status' = 'active' and 'role' = 'superuser' views avatar from user who is 'status' = 'active' and 'role' = 'user'
      1. ... etc
