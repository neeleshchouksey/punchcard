  summary: View Own Profile
  description: |
    ## Testing

    This endpoint shows the user their own profile. It only should work with the user's own ID, not with another user's id.
    There is no `uniq_id` to pass to make it work. The user is authenticated, using the Authorization header, and it shows
    them their profile information.

    Please make sure all of the fields listed below exist in the result.

    - name: Authorization

  summary: Update Own Profile
  description: |
    ## Testing

    This endpoint allows the user to update their own profile. While we send the updated profile information in their body,
    we do not send an `id` or `uniq_id`. The Authorization header will allow us to find the `id` of the user updating their
    own profile. It will return a successful message, and also the updated information, in json.

    Please test by changing the field names, removing field names, adding new field names that shouldn't exist, and try the
    `PUT` operation to update the information.
