        ## Testing

        This endpoint allows the client-applications (aka Consumer) to verify if the user is already checked-in to a
        project. Since the user can only get checked into one thing at a time, no further data is required beyond that
        the user is authenticated.

    ## Testing

    This endpoint created a check-in. The user can only be checked into one thing at a time, so it checks
    if they are already checked in to something, and if so, returns an error message stating so. If not, it shows
    that they are now checked into the project represented by `{uniq_id}`

    If they are already checked in, a message will display saying they are checked in, instead.
    `exceptionReason` is required as a field, but a value is not required.
    It should be null if there is no reason. If there is anything besides `null`, it is logged!

    Note on 10/23/16 - I changed the validation on `exceptionReason` and it wasn't nullable for a short time. It is fixed now. - Hans

    **10/25/16 - Added requirements for all but user_id. The user_id field can be:**

      - null, if checkMethod is 'geo'
      - uuid, if checkMethod is 'qr' (scanning QR badge barcode)

    **10/27/2016 - removed ` - integer, if checkMethod is 'manual' (aka: badge ID checkin)` - badge/manual checkin point moved to /check/badge and the badge_id is project_user.id**

    **10/31/2016 - MOVED "manual" (badge) and "qr" to /check/badge and /check/qr respectively. Also: checkMethod is no longer required; user_id is no longer required.**

    ## Testing

    This endpoint will check a user out. Because a user will need to be checked in, in order to check out, this will
    check if they are already checked-in.  If they are not yet checked in, it will respond with an error saying so.

    If they are not checked in, a message will display saying they are not checked in, instead.
    `exceptionReason` is required as a field, but a value is not required.
    It should be null if there is no reason. If there is anything besides `null`, it is logged!
