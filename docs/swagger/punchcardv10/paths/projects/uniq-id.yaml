    ## Testing

    Show one project. This should be only a project the user is able to view, based on:
      - User is 'added' to the project by a superuser or above.
      - User is 'active'

    This might be difficult to test right now, as you will need to log in as a `superuser`, add users to projects in
    that endpoint, then log in as each user, and verify that they are on the project.  Then, log in as the `superuser`
    and remove them, then log in and verify they are no longer able to see the project.
