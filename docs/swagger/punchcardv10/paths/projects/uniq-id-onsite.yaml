    ## Testing

    This endpoint should only be availabe to a `superuser` or above. Please try it as a `user` for each round of regression to
    ensure that a `user` cannot use this endpoint.

    This endpoint should show a list of users that are on a specific project, and include whether they are punched in or not,
    and when the last time they punched in or out of this project was.

    - name: Authorization
      in: header
      required: true
      type: string
    - name: uniq_id
      in: path
      required: true
      type: string
  responses:
    200:
      description: "Ok; superuser or better consumer receives list of the project's users - project defined by <uniq_id>"
