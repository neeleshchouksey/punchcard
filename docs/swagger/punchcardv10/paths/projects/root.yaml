    ## Testing

    This endpoint shows a list of projects the user is on, if any. For the test data-seeding, all active users should be tied
    to a project, though that might change in future seeding rounds.

    Please pay close attention to the data structure and validate the order of results and verify this documentation is accurate.

    Please note the /projects/{uniq_id} endpoint testing about being added/removed from projects to verify the same here.
